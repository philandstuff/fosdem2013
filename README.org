#+TITLE FOSDEM 2013

* Nathan Harvey, Learning to Automate
** evolving towards automation:
   - just make it work
   - then write notes and store in server.txt
   - then publish those notes in wiki
   - then convert notes to scripts
   - then put scripts into source control
     - and not the =.bak= or =.<date>= kind
* Brian Berry, Using Ruby testing frameworks for sanity
** standard shape:
   - appservers, loadbalancers, database nodes, database caches
** big data deathstar is coming
   - hadoop, zookeeper, apache mesos
** testing; two kinds
   - white box
   - black box
** you should use ruby
   - lightweight
   - libraries
   - rspec
   - easy to mock services (sinatra) (what does this mean?)
   - vagrant!
** minitest chef handler
